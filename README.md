This integration uses an undocumented API, use at your own risk. This integration uses the same domain name as the official Flexit-integration, so in its current state you can't use both at the same time.

Tested with:

- Nordic S2
- Nordic S3
- Nordic S4
- Nordic CL4

## Requirements

- Your Flexit-unit needs to be connected to the Internet
- Unit needs to be registered in the Flexit Go-app

## Keep in mind

The integration only polls every 30 min by default. When durations and delays are set, the integration and the app might become out of sync. Not sure how to avoid this without polling a lot more.

For instance, if you set a duration_fireplace to 5 minutes and change the mode to Fireplace, then HA will think the state is Fireplace until the next poll, when in reality it changed back after 5 minutes.

This also goes for away_delay. If this is set, the integration switches to Away right away, but it only activates after the delay has passed.

## Known issues

- [ ] Stuck in Away-mode.

  If you turn on away-mode with delay set, and set the delay to 0 before switching modes it will be stuck in away-mode. This is because the API "toggles" these modes on and off, and I haven't found any good ways of reading from the API if the mode is set with delay or not. Therefore we use the delay-variable at runtime to check if we should toggle it off.

## Service information

### Service status

Service status can be found [here](https://status.climatixic.com/)

### API limitation

API is restricted to 50 calls/min or 500 calls/week. The integration calls the API at least twice per action, depending on the endpoint. Defaults to polling every 30 minutes, this can be configured but be aware of API restrictions.

## Debugging

If something is not working properly, logs might help with debugging. To turn on debug-logging add this to your `configuration.yaml`

```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.flexit: debug
```

PS: This will log various details, including all HTTP-requests for the Flexit-integration to your home-assistant.log. This includes your username and password in cleartext in your Token-requests.
